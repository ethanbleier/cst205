Double Negative - task 1
I don't understand the question but I know
this code will negate the image by taking 
the 'negatives' of the original

from PIL import Image
im2 = Image.open('images/beach.jpg')

negative_list = [(255-p[0], 255-p[1], 255-p[2])
                            for p in im2.getdata()]

im2.putdata(negative_list)
im2.show()
